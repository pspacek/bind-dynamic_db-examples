1) Compile and install BIND 9 with patches from
https://github.com/spacekpe/bind-dynamic_db

2) Compile this sample driver:
$ make

3) Copy resulting binary sample.so to BIND library directory:
$ cp sample.so /usr/lib64/bind/

4) Add driver configuration to named.conf:
$ cat >> /etc/named.conf <<EOF
dynamic-db "sample" {
        library "sample.so";
        arg "test.";
        arg "arpa.";
};
EOF

5) Run named and see logs.
$ named -g -u named

You should be able to see something like
[driver minimal-driver][instance sample] driver init
[driver minimal-driver][instance sample] arg[0] = 'test.'
[driver minimal-driver][instance sample] arg[1] = 'arpa.'

It means that dynamic_driver_init() function from driver.c was called!
This function can do anything you like and is not limited in any way.

You can reconfigure BIND at run-time, create and remove zones etc.
See other examples for more advanced usage.
